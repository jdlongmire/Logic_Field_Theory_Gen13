## 🧠 Overview

Logic Field Theory (LFT) is a foundational framework that modifies quantum mechanics by introducing **logical strain** as the governing constraint on physical realization. It preserves the formalism of QM but replaces amplitude-based collapse assumptions with strain-dependent realizability. LFT predicts:

- **Temporal decay in measurement success**  
- **Null outcomes from logical overstrain**  
- **Platform-dependent realization behavior**

These predictions are falsifiable with current quantum computing platforms.
