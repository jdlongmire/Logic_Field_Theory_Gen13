# Logic_Field_Theory_Gen13
Logic Field Theory (LFT) proposes that physical reality emerges from logical constraints acting on information states. Collapse probability is determined by logical strain, not pure amplitude. LFT preserves QM math but modifies interpretation, enabling falsifiable predictions and experimental validation.
